# MiniWiki documentation

Hi, you've found the documentation for MiniWiki.
I need to add text here!

## This is a level-2 heading

Also, here's some more information for you.
I mean, not really; but just imagine I had something to tell you here and that it would be kinda cool.
When you come back here in the future, there will magically be some actual content.

```
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Btw, this is what code blocks look like")
    // I need to add a different font for them though, 
    // this one's kinda large
}
```

### This is a level-3 heading

I wanted to show you another thing.
- Have you heard of
- Lists?

1. Someone also told
    1. me that they 
    2. do them nested and
    3. numbered now
